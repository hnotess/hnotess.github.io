One of the things I wanted to try after going through a lot of the early-stage Free Code Camp curriculum was building the Portfolio website project.

After lots of fiddling, [here's the site I came up with](https://hnotess.github.io/fccportfolio/).

I'm picky about design. In my day-to-day work I work closely with graphic design and there are a few key principles that I've noticed that I thought would apply to this project. For one, good design relies heavily on both the quality of your photography, whenever you use photography as a visual element. Additionally, less is so very often more when it comes to color palettes, fonts, and other visual elements. I started by building out the basic structure of the site in HTML, then started experimenting with CSS and Bootstrap, particularly using Bootstrap to make the boxes where the projects would go. I fiddled with the color palette for much longer than necessary, but eventually, I chose to use one nice photograph and base all of the site colors around that image. There are so many color picking tools out there, but I ended up using one (I forget which one now) that was based on the photo. I also selected the Roboto font family from Google Fonts for a clean look. The basic CSS courses in Code School gave me what I needed to put this together - I found them really beginner-friendly and easy to follow.

Maybe the best part of this learning opportunity was really just getting to dig into documentation with CSS and Bootstrap. I find the Bootstrap docs really easy to follow and understand, and I'm just getting more comfortable reading docs and finding good sources for whatever info I need. That feels like a good accomplishment.

I'm happy with the overall look, given that this is the first thing I really hand-coded from scratch. There's definitely room for improvement. Most of the site assets are loaded from external links, which isn't necessarily optimal for speed. Additionally, the color contrast could be improved for accessibility. 

But for a first go, I don't think it's too bad.
