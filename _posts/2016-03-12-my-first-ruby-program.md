To get myself a little bit more comfortable with installing and running programs from the command line, I installed Ruby and RVM on my terminal, and decided to write a very simple Ruby program. 

It is a very simple program using the `"gets.chomp"` command to concatenate a string.

Since I like to listen to â€™90s R&B while programming, I named it after a Destiny's Child song.

Here is my [source code](https://github.com/hnotess/saymyname).
