I completed the FreeCodeCamp [tribute page challenge](http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-tribute-page) using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for a [very basic page](http://codepen.io/hnotess/full/eJxbej/) built in Codepen.

You can take a look at the rest of my activity and progress on my [Free Code Camp profile page](http://www.freecodecamp.com/hnotess).
